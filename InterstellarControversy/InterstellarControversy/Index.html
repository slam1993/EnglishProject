                    <p class="ar_text">
                        Schools are currently teaching children that the Apollo space program was a fake. Teachers discuss that the moon landing program was just a "brilliant piece of propaganda to
                        bankrupt the Soviets into pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines." Textbooks have been modified to relay the current view of space exploration. This is an
                        unjust to the space exploration program as well as to survival of the human race.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ar_text">
                        The government has abolished NASA to conform with the view of the unnecessary need for space exploration. We have just lost a valuable asset to our survival of the blight
                        problems that we are seeing currently. The government and educational system has just removed other options of survival from this blight problem without our consent. They even
                        collaborated with each other to remove contents about space exploration in order to gather more farmers to produce crops and food.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ar_text">
                        Children of the next generation should learn that there is hope out in the universe to find an inhabitable planet for us to migrate to. We can populate that planet and grow 
                        different crops beside corn. Diversify the community into people researching the space in order for our survival, people farming the land for food, and people striving to 
                        figure out a method to grow other crops beside corn.

                                This image is a photo of an astronaut (a person from our planet) that has landed on the moon. This person is posing for the camera but the angle of the camera isn't correct.
                                In order for them to take a picture, they had to use their helmet camera to take a picture.

                                This image contains an astronaut walking to his shuttle. In the background, there are no stars. That is because the image was taken with low exposure and fast shutter speed.
                                In order for a camera to take a picture of the stars, there has to be long exposure in order to obtain the stars.

                                that we have successfully landed on the moon and obtained substances from there.

                    <p>
                        The government and schools are halting our progress in salvation from the blight problems and in space exploration. We have so much evidence but the government and schools 
                        are silencing us. It is time for us to stop being ignorant about these things and start looking into life outside Earth. It may be hard, but for our survival it is a must.
